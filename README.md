# ecommerce-react

## Description

This sample ecommerce app uses some classic front end bootstrap styling with react to present a few options for mock purchases. Those are 
then collected into a cart and sent to a test purchase server through stripe.

## Major Tech

  - GraphQL database
  - React front end
  - Stripe
  - MongoDB

## Further development

I am currently focused on deployment to AWS with this application. From there, I will add more seed data to the AWS deployment and set up stripe to be
100% integrated.
